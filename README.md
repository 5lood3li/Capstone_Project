# Tourism Sector Investment in the Saudi Vision 2030: Saudi Restaurant Market

Restaurant’s sector is important when we want to talk about tourism. It is two combined sectors that work to gather. Without restaurants there is no good tourism and without tourism there no good restaurants.

## Problem Statement:
Since Saudi Arabia is the heart of the middle east and it still not fully released yet as tourism destination there is opportunity in tourism development. In order to achieve the Saudi Vision 2030 for the Tourism and Restaurants industries we decided to enhance the user experience in tourism and restaurant market by implementing a recommendation system to expand this industry and quality of user experience.

## Approach: 
### Recommendation Systems for Saudi Restaurant: 
For this Capstone Project, we will build recommendation system models to recommend restaurants based on review scores and location in three cities Riyadh, Jeddah, and Eastern Province.

## The goal of the case study:

For this capstone project, we wanted to build something that would benefit the restaurants market and many people in their everyday lives. We built recommendation system models based on generated Saudi dataset. The first model is designed to solve the user cold-start problem, and we provide two solutions. First solution is to build a model that could recommend people restaurants near their geographical location using K nearest neighbor. Second solution is to build a computer vision model that could provide restaurant’s information such as the rating score, categories and special diet that the restaurant offers.

When we have a good historical data, we could use our recommendation system Which follows the logic “if you like this restaurant, you might also like that”, and this is called item-item collaborative filtering recommendation system. 

Also, there is another type of collaborative filtering recommendation system called user-item collaborative filtering recommendation system. this type works by searching a large group of people and finding a smaller set of users with tastes similar to a particular user. To further make sense of the data and understand the costumer, we will be performing sentiment analysis on the text content of the reviews to understand user sentiment on their overall emotional experience dining at different restaurants.
